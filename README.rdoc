== Java algorithm problems
This is an assortment of typical algorithmic problems solved in Java.
Twists on some of these problems are typically asked on an interview
for a technical position, and most of them are entertaining to code.
Most of these problems are from Hackerrank, Topcoder, Codeforces, or random
books.

Feel free to add new problems and solve the ones in the unsolved folder.
